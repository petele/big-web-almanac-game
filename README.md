The Big Web Almanac Quiz is a [Chrome DevRel](https://twitter.com/ChromiumDev)
hackathon project built by [Rick Viscomi](https://twitter.com/rick_viscomi),
[Pete LePage](https://twitter.com/petele), and
[Una Kravets](https://twitter.com/Una). All of the data is pulled from the
2021 [Web Almanac](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2021/), which uses data
directly sourced from the [HTTP Archive](https://httparchive.org/).

**This is a hackathon project. Don't @ us.** We don't have plans to maintain
this, accept PRs, etc. You're welcome to fork it and create your own
version.

## Gameplay

The object of the game is to answer as many questions as you can get right
in 60 seconds. You want to maximize for both speed and accuracy. To submit
an answer, either click on it with a pointer device or use your keyboard.
Once an answer is selected, the game will automatically advance. Good luck!

## Keyboard navigation

You can use your keyboard to answer questions with the `tab` and `enter` keys.
You can also use the `1`, `2`, `3`, and `4` keys to select an answer,
starting from top left, moving right to bottom right.
